    - "git push origin <branch>" to push to a particular branch?

Dash Deployment Instructions (from main dash site): https://dash.plotly.com/deployment
    - There are 4 files necessary for the app to run
        a) .gitignore
            1. topline of this file says "venv" - I think this just means to put the name of the virtual environment
        b) Procfile
            1. Does "app" in "app:server" refer to the name of the app file?
        c) requirements.txt
            1. Used "pip freeze > requirements.txt" in command line with the virtual env activated to create this
               intially (copied and pasted this later)
        d) <app>.py
            1. Seems like a server variable that references the "app.server" attribute is needed

Make changes to an existing app: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git
    - use "heroku git:remote -a <app>" to estalish connection with the app and make changes to it?
