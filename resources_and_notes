Dash Deployment Instructions (from main dash site): https://dash.plotly.com/deployment
    - There are 4 files necessary for the app to run
        a) .gitignore
            1. topline of this file says "venv" - I think this just means to put the name of the virtual environment
        b) Procfile
        c) requirements.txt
            1. Used "pip freeze > requirements.txt" in command line with the virtual env activated to create this
               intially (copied and pasted this later)
        d) <app>.py
            1. Seems like a server variable that references the "app.server" attribute is needed
